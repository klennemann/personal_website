Dear Hiring Manager,

\vspace{15pt}

My name is Katinka Lennemann, and I am writing to express my interest in the Research Analyst position at Resources for the Future!

I am graduating this spring with a Bachelor’s in Statistics & Data Science, and I am applying for this role because it aligns closely with my experience supporting environmental programs through research, analysis, and implementation. While I originally envisioned a purely technical career, my work in climate policy and program delivery has shown me how essential strong institutions and well-run programs are to creating lasting environmental change.

My interest in this work began with grassroots organizing in my own school district, where I built coalitions, advocated for policy change, and helped establish a sustainability committee that remains active today. Since then, I have sought roles that combine values with execution. As a Curriculum Coordinator, I conducted qualitative research with water managers, tribal governments, and frontline communities to inform climate education programs implemented across California schools. More recently, as an intern with San Mateo County’s Sustainability Department, I supported clean energy program implementation by tracking performance data, coordinating contractors and procurement processes, and developing data tools to inform equity-based infrastructure planning within local government constraints.

Through additional experiences such as serving as a U.S. Delegate to the ASEAN Foundation’s Model East Asia Summit and studying at the National University of Singapore, I have strengthened my ability to synthesize research, communicate clearly, and work across institutional and cultural contexts. I would be excited to bring my analytical, organizational, and program support skills to this role. Thank you for considering my application.

Katinka Lennemann
